Overview

This repository presents a physics-based bipedal robot simulation developed in MuJoCo, focused on stable walking, stair climbing, and obstacle traversal under challenging conditions.

The project emphasizes:

Dynamic balance and contact-aware locomotion

Robust control under external disturbances and terrain variation

Multi-modal locomotion, including flat walking, stair ascent, and step-up maneuvers

Extension toward low-gravity and lunar environments

This work is part of my broader research interest in robotic mobility for space and planetary exploration, including applications on the Moon and other low-gravity bodies, where reliable legged locomotion over uneven and structured terrain (e.g., stairs, lander access structures) is critical.
